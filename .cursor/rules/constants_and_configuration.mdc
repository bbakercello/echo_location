# Constants and Configuration

## Magic Numbers
- **NEVER** use magic numbers in code - always use named constants
- Define constants at the top of the file, grouped by purpose
- Use descriptive names that explain what the value represents
- Use appropriate types: `const SPEED: float = 10.0` not `const SPEED = 10`

## Constant Organization
- Group related constants together with comments
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for all constants
- Calculate derived constants from base constants when possible
- Document what constants represent and their units

## Configuration Values
- Make gameplay values easily configurable via constants
- Use meaningful default values
- Consider using `@export` for values that designers might tweak
- Keep related configuration values together

## Examples of Good Constants
```gdscript
# Movement
const ACCEL := 10.0
const DECEL := 18.0
const MAX_SPEED := 20.0
const JUMP_VELOCITY := 7.5

# Raycasting
const RAY_LENGTH := 60.0
const RAY_HEIGHT := 1.0
const CLOSE_RANGE_DISTANCE := 2.0
const FACE_DOT_THRESHOLD := 0.7  # ~45 degree cone

# Collision Layers
const LAYER_PLAYER := 1
const LAYER_ENEMY := 2
const LAYER_ENVIRONMENT := 4
```

## Bad Examples (Magic Numbers)
```gdscript
# BAD - Magic numbers
if distance < 2.0:
    detect_enemy()
velocity = lerp(velocity, target, 10.0 * delta)

# GOOD - Named constants
if distance < CLOSE_RANGE_DISTANCE:
    detect_enemy()
velocity = lerp(velocity, target, ACCEL * delta)
```
