# Assets Directory

Place your game assets in the appropriate subdirectories:

- **sprites/**: 2D sprites, UI elements, and sprite sheets
- **models/**: 3D models (.glb, .gltf, .obj formats)
- **textures/**: Texture files for materials (.png, .jpg, etc.)

Godot will automatically import assets when you add them to these folders.
